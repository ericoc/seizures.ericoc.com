I have been using Apple Shortcuts to hit this sort of little custom-built Flask HTTPS API.
Every time that I run the shortcut, it writes a bunch of neat data (including device name, latitude, longitude, altitude, battery, volume, brightness, and network SSID or IP address of the device!) to an InfluxDB measurement.
This is extraordinarily helpful so that I can track when and where I have seizures!
