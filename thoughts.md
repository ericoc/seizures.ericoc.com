# Thoughts/Ideas

## Markers
- Should marker icons be different per device (like the emojis)?
- Should markers on the map be numbered?

## Apple Shortcut
- Safely publish/share the Apple Shortcut (`.shortcut`) file
  - Prompt for URL, username, and password?

## Voice
- Voice command/control from Amazon Alexa would be great.
  - Probably more realistic with an Apple HomePod.
  - GPS on HomePod/Alexa devices is odd, since they usually do not move.

### Storage
- Consider moving the local PostgreSQL database to the Snowflake warehouse too

- Python receives a JSON POST request from the Apple shortcut.
  - Data could be stored in JSON(B?) field(s).
    - Similarly to
      [https://github.com/ericoc/indego.ericoc.com/](https://github.com/ericoc/indego.ericoc.com/).

### Display
- Hourly grouping.
  - Graph the hour(s) of each day that has the most events?
