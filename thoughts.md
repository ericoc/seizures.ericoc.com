# Thoughts/Ideas

## JavaScript
- Need to remove duplicated JavaScript from chart, table, and map pages.

## Visualization
- Graph which hours of the day seizures occur most often.

## Map Markers
- Should map marker icons be numbered, or different per device (like emojis)?
  - [https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/](https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/) 
  - Emojis per device type markers were _very_ hard to actually see on the map.
    - Device type emojis seemed to blend into the map.

## Backend/Storage
- Python receives a JSON POST request from the Apple shortcut.
  - Data could be stored in JSON(B?) field(s).
    - _Similar to

## Users
- Update details/"profile":
  - First name
  - Last name
  - E-mail address
  - Password
  - Default/"main" view:
    - Chart
    - Map _(current)_
    - Table


- _"Forgot Password?"_
- _"Remember Me?"_
