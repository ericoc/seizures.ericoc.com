# Thoughts/Ideas

## JavaScript
- Need to remove duplicated JavaScript from chart, table, and main/map pages.

---

## Accessibility

### Voice
- Voice command/control from Amazon Alexa would be great.
  - Probably more realistic with an Apple HomePod.
  - GPS on HomePod/Alexa devices is odd, since they _generally_ do not move.

---

## Display
- Hourly grouping.
  - Graph showing which hours of the day seizures occur most often.

### Map Markers
- Should map marker icons be numbered, or different per device (like emojis)?

---

## Backend/Storage
- Python receives a JSON POST request from the Apple shortcut.
  - Data could be stored in JSON(B?) field(s).
