# Thoughts/Ideas

## JavaScript
- Need to remove duplicated JavaScript from chart, table, and map pages.

## Visualization
- Graph which hours of the day seizures occur most often.
- Highlight, colorize, or otherwise emphasize clusters of seizures.

## Map Markers
- Should map marker icons be numbered, or different per device (emojis)?
  - [https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/](https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/) 
  - Emojis per device type markers were _very_ hard to actually see on the map.
    - Device type emojis seemed to blend into the map.

## Backend/Storage
- Python receives a JSON POST request from the Apple shortcut.
  - Data could be stored in JSON(B?) field(s).
    - _Similar to
      [https://github.com/ericoc/indego.ericoc.com/](https://github.com/ericoc/indego.ericoc.com/)_

## Users
More (self-)user management would probably be cool
_(if this had more than one user)_.

#### Details _("Profile")_:
  - First name
  - Last name
  - E-mail address
  - Password
  - Preferences
    - Default/"main" view
      - Chart
      - Map _(current)_
      - Table

#### _"Forgot Password?"_
#### _"Remember Me?"_
